ðŸ§ª How to Score the Bake-off
Prepare Data

Ensure recipe titles, instructions, ingredients, cuisine, and metadata are all available.

Index text fields for full-text search and vector search separately.

Run Both Searches for each query:

For full-text: Use exact/boolean operators.

For vector search: Use embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-3-small).

Score per Query:

Precision: Relevant results / Total results returned.

Recall: Relevant results found / All relevant results in dataset.

Optional Relevance Ranking: Rate top 5 results on a 1â€“5 scale.

Compare:

Expect Queries 1â€“8 to be stronger in vector.

Expect Queries 9â€“15 to be stronger in full-text.
